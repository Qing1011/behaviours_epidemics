Information and Consent



The following survey asks multiple choice questions about some financial preferences as well as your personal experiences living in New York City during the pandemic. You will be asked several questions with various options where you decide which you prefer. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions, just pick whichever option(s) you prefer. Afterwards, you will be asked about ten more questions about your background and living arrangements during the pandemic. These are broad questions that do not allow you to be identified personally. The information we collect from you will only be used for the purposes of academic research and there are no anticipated risks for participation.



The entire survey should take 15 to 20 minutes. For those eligible to receive a $10 gift certificate based on zip code, you will have the opportunity to provide contact information at the end of the survey. Otherwise, you will not be contacted after. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Dr Sen Pei at sp3449@cumc.columbia.edu.
